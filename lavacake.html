  <ul>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Spray 6 (6-ounce, 170 gram) ramekins with nonstick baking spray.</li>
    <li>Coat the insides of the buttered ramekins with granulated sugar, tapping out the excess.</li>
    <li>Combine the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute.</li>
    <li> Stir, then continue heating in 30 second bursts, stirring between bursts, until the mixture is melted and smooth.
    </li>
    <li> Alternatively, melt the chocolate and butter in a double boiler. Gently stir in the flour and salt.
    </li>
    <li> In a medium bowl vigorously whisk the eggs, egg yolks, vanilla, and the 1/2 cup of granulated sugar until thick and pale in color.
    </li>
    <li> Gently fold in the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture. Divide the batter among the ramekins.
    </li>
    <font color="red">MAKE AHEAD:</font>
    <li> At this point the batter-filled ramekins can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day.
    </li>
    <li> Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the edges are firm but the center is runny.
    </li>
    <li> Add an additional minute of baking time if baking straight from the fridge.
    </li>
    <li> Run a knife around the edges to loosen and invert onto dessert plates, if desired.
    </li>
    <li> You can also serve straight from the ramekin. Serve with fresh berries and powdered sugar.
    </li>

    Recipe Notes
    You can bake the batter in 10 paper-lined muffin tins for 10 minutes for smaller, more portable servings.
    You can also easily cut this recipe in half.
